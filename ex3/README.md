# Example 3: CUDA temperature/GBMV2/SA-MSES replica exchange simulation

## Executable CHARMM (included GBMV2/SA)

Before running the following the examples, please install the CHARMM with MSES plugin (version > c45). 
Also, please run a test file included to make sure your GBMV2/SA and MSES calculations are correct.

## Executable modified MMTSB

In this modified MMTSB, we added the supports on the multiple gpus calculations and GBMV2/SA-MSES CUDA calculations.

## Running CHARMM input file

Please look at the run.sh document and 
the tutorial on the usage of aarex.pl at [MMTSB](http://blue11.bch.msu.edu/mmtsb/aarex.pl)
